To address this we developed our MVP, which is already the best portfolio tracker on the market, and will quickly turn into so much more as we progress towards our vision.</p>

          Quickly check the evolution of your portfolio, and what you currently own without having to manually input every transaction you make. <br>
          Use our entirely modular approach based on accounts, portfolios and overall picture to tailor your portfolio tracking experience to your personal needs.<br>
          Stay up to date on the market by visualizing the Coinmarketcap top 100.<br>
          The Galion MVP is fully responsive, so you can use it via your mobile or tablet. Stay tuned, mobile apps are the first major milestones of our dense roadmap!<br>
        </p>
        <p class="section-text" id="wallets" style="display:none">
          <strong>Automated tracking</strong><br>
          Galion is interfaced with exchanges APIs and blockchains. The value of every compatible account you have is automatically synced with Galion, without the need for any human intervention. Currently supported blockchains and accounts: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Binance, Kraken, Bittrex. More coming soon!<br>
          Of course, if you wish to track your investments on accounts that are not yet supported by Galion, you can still manually add your transactions.<br>

          <strong>Ledger Integration</strong><br>
          Use the Galion web app to generate and broadcast Ethereum transactions with your Ledger Nano S.<br>
          Since our vision is to make Galion much more than a tracking app, we wanted our users to feel that the first steps towards this vision are already in place within our MVP. We decided to integrate Ledger, because of its great track record and acclaimed security.
