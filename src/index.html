        <h1 class="section-title">Our MVP</h1>
        <p class="section-text">
          This project was born of the lack of a good portfolio management solution, which the market needed following the quick rise in the number of blockchains and tokens. To address this we developed our MVP, which is already the best portfolio tracker on the market, and will quickly turn into so much more as we progress towards our vision.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Clear financial picture</strong><br>
          Quickly check the evolution of your portfolio, and what you currently own without having to manually input every transaction you make. <br>
          Use our entirely modular approach based on accounts, portfolios and overall picture to tailor your portfolio tracking experience to your personal needs.<br>
          Stay up to date on the market by visualizing the Coinmarketcap top 100.<br>
          The Galion MVP is fully responsive, so you can use it via your mobile or tablet. Stay tuned, mobile apps are the first major milestones of our dense roadmap!<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Automated tracking</strong><br>
          Galion is interfaced with exchanges APIs and blockchains. The value of every compatible account you have is automatically synced with Galion, without the need for any human intervention. Currently supported blockchains and accounts: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Binance, Kraken, Bittrex. More coming soon!<br>
          Of course, if you wish to track your investments on accounts that are not yet supported by Galion, you can still manually add your transactions.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ledger Integration</strong><br>
          Use the Galion web app to generate and broadcast Ethereum transactions with your Ledger Nano S.<br>
          Since our vision is to make Galion much more than a tracking app, we wanted our users to feel that the first steps towards this vision are already in place within our MVP. We decided to integrate Ledger, because of its great track record and acclaimed security.

          Our first priority for the semester following the Token Sale is to complete our team, to harden our architecture both in capacity and security by having third party audits and establishing a bug bounty program, and to roll out our mobile apps.

        <div class="text text-2019s1 show-on-mobile" style="display: none">

          S2 2019<br>
          We will then expand the scope of the platform and apps to get one step closer to the final vision: this is when Galion becomes the only financial app people need, as it incorporates access to traditional bank accounts and third party services.

          2020 will be the year when Galion turns into the ultimate financial app. We will reach the vision we initially had in mind when founding the company, making it truly global and future proof. From there, we will keep refining it and improving it to always give our users one step ahead of the financial game.

              Q1: Set-up of the technical infrastructure
            </h3>
            <p>We carefully thought out the design of the technical infrastructure so that it can scale easily, both in the number of users it supports but also in the sources it aggregates. A strong emphasis was put on security and data privacy, designing it so that we could go on knowing the least possible information about our users and ensure our operation was secure.</p>

          <li>Since the viability of our project strongly depends on the number of users we have, 40% of our funds will be spent in marketing & customer acquisition.</li>

          <li>We also partnered with LegalUp Consulting, a law firm specialized in data protection and privacy law to ensure we are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union framework and the leading consumer privacy protection to date.</li>
          <li>We run Galion using the most up-to-date and effective security procedures, including employee training, stringent security policy including mandatory two factor authentication across the board and full disk encryption, among others.</li>
          <li>We have taken significant steps to ensure resistance to DDoS, personal data leaks, and chose the most secure certificate with extended verification to authenticate our website.</li>
